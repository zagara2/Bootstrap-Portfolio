# Portfolio (Bootstrap Version)

## What is it?
A version of my portfolio site that uses Bootstrap grids rather than media queries to make the site adapt to different screen sizes. Bootstrap is also used to create the heading, panels, etc. 

**This version of the portfolio site is (intentionally) not populated with my actual project data or a functional contact form, rather, it uses placeholders.** I simply created it as a demonstration of my Bootstrap ability. 

The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/ .

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It works as it should on all of these browsers.

Plans to test on Safari are upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small desktop (1280x1024), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions.

Here is the desktop layout of the site, as it should look when loaded properly:

Here is the mobile layout of the site, as it should look when loaded properly:
